# Food-in-India

 Here is a direct link to the CSV I used in my project: [ https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/himanshupoddar/zomato-bangalore-restaurants](url)

# The summary of my project is :

The project dives into how people in India experience food from restaurants. We're especially interested in the first time someone orders from a restaurant, whether they make a call or use the Internet.

India, being culturally diverse, offers a variety of foods. We want to know how people's first experiences with a restaurant affect the ratings they give. We're also looking at the trend of more people ordering food online and want to see how this affects their satisfaction with the food and the restaurant.

The study aims to understand if how people order—whether by talking on the phone or clicking online—affects how happy they are with the food and the overall experience. We're also checking out how delivery services impact people's opinions and the ratings they give.

In essence, we're exploring how the first interaction with a restaurant, whether through a phone call or an online order, influences what people think about the food and the restaurant, and how these experiences affect the ratings they assign in the diverse food culture of India.
